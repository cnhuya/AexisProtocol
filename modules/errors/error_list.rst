Contracts must be marked as abstract when at least one of their functions is not implemented or when
they do not provide arguments for all of their base contract constructors.
Even if this is not the case, a contract may still be marked abstract, such as when you do not intend
for the contract to be created directly. Abstract contracts are similar to :ref:`interfaces` but an
interface is more limited in what it can declare.

An abstract contract is declared using the ``abstract`` keyword as shown in the following example.
Note that this contract needs to be defined as abstract, because the function ``utterance()`` is declared,
but no implementation was provided (no implementation body ``{ }`` was given).
